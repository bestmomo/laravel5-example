Mocking Public Properties
=========================

Mockery allows you to mock properties in several ways. The simplest is that
you can simply set a public property and value on any mock object. The second
is that you can use the expectation methods ``set()`` and ``andSet()`` to set
property values if that expectation is ever met.

You should note that, in general, Mockery does not support mocking any magic
methods since these are generally not considered a public API (and besides
they are a PITA to differentiate when you badly need them for mocking!). So
please mock virtual properties (those relying on ``__get()`` and ``__set()``)
as if they were actually declared on the class.
